# The Ultimate vimrc

my own instance of [ultimate vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc), with some tweaks, some plugins removed,
most importantly that part with OVERRIDING $ KEY IN INSERT MODE is removed.

This might be useful to you if you have the exact same preferences as I do. Otherwise look for details on the fork source.
